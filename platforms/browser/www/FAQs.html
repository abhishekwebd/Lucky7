<p>The <span class="text-bold">TOEFL iBT</span> test, delivered via the internet, measures reading, listening, speaking and writing skills. It is offered more than 50 times a year and is administered online at testing sites around the world.</p>
<p>The <span class="text-bold">TOEFL PBT</span> test, which has been discontinued, was a paper-and-pencil test that measured reading, listening, grammar and writing skills and was offered only in locations where testing via the internet is not available.</p>
<p>The <span class="text-bold">revised TOEFL Paper-delivered Test</span>, which replaced the TOEFL PBT test, measures reading, listening and writing. There is no speaking component because of the technical requirements of capturing spoken responses.</p>

<p>When you register, remember to:</p>
<ul>
<li>have your <span class="text-bold">identification</span> with you. Your name must be entered exactly as it appears on the identification (ID) you bring with you on test day, and you will be required to enter identification information before you can register for a test.

<li>The Reading section includes 3 or 4 reading passages. There are 12 to 14 questions per passage. You have from 60 to 80 minutes to answer all the questions in the section.</li>
<li>TOEFL iBT Reading passages are excerpts from university-level textbooks that would be used in introductions to a discipline or topic. The passages cover a variety of different subjects. Don't worry if you're not familiar with the topic of a passage. All the information you need to answer the questions will be included in the passage.</li>

<p>The Speaking section is approximately 20 minutes long and includes 6 questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first 2 questions are called "independent Speaking tasks" because they require you to draw entirely on your own ideas, opinions and experiences when you respond.</li>
<li>The other 4 questions are called "integrated Speaking tasks" because they require you to integrate your English-language skills — listening and speaking or listening, reading and speaking — just as you would in or out of a classroom.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will speak into the microphone on your headset and your responses will be recorded and sent to ETS, where they will be scored by certified human raters.</p>

<li>Your recorded responses are sent to ETS, where 3 to 6 certified human raters score them holistically on a scale of 0 to 4. The average score on the 6 tasks is converted to a scaled score of 0 to 30.</li>
<li>Raters do not expect your responses to be perfect, and even high-scoring responses may contain occasional errors. Your pronunciation does not need to sound like that of a native English speaker. The raters are listening for the effectiveness of your communication and your ability to accomplish the tasks you are given.</li>
<li>See the <a class="lsa-notrans lsa-encontent" href="/s/toefl/pdf/toefl_speaking_rubrics.pdf ">Speaking scoring guides</a> and listen to <a class="lsa-notrans lsa-encontent" href="/toefl/ibt/prepare/sample_questions">sample responses</a> to help you understand how responses are evaluated.</li>

<ul>
<li>Writing responses are scored holistically on a scale of 0 to 5. The average score on the 2 tasks is converted to a scaled score of 0 to 30.</li>
<li>You're not expected to produce a comprehensive essay about a specialized topic — your response is recognized as a first draft. You can receive a high score with an essay that contains some errors.</li>
<li>See the <a class="lsa-notrans lsa-encontent" href="/s/toefl/pdf/toefl_writing_rubrics.pdf" title="This link opens in a new window" target="_blank">Writing Scoring Guides <span class="is-pdf">(PDF)</span></a> and read <a class="lsa-notrans lsa-encontent" href="/toefl/ibt/prepare/sample_questions">sample responses</a> to help you understand how responses are evaluated.</li>

</dd><dt class="faq-q" tabindex="0" title="show the answer to Do I need to wear headphones for the test?">Do I need to wear headphones for the test?</dt><dd id="faq_66" style="display: none;">

</dd><dt class="faq-q" tabindex="0" title="show the answer to Which computer keyboard is used?">Which computer keyboard is used?</dt><dd id="faq_67" style="display: none;">
<p>The TOEFL iBT test uses a standard English-language (QWERTY) computer keyboard. It takes its name from the first 6 letters in the third row of the keyboard. If you haven't used this kind of keyboard before, practice on one before test day to become familiar with it. In some countries, the common keyboard used is configured to QWERTY and a template is provided to each test taker to help with locating the few keys that are in a different location.</p>
